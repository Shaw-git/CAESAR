# CAESAR  
**A Unified Framework of Foundation and Generative Models for Efficient Compression of Scientific Data**

---

## 📖 Overview  

![CAESAR Framework Overview](/figures/caesar_overview.png)

We introduce **CAESAR**, a new framework for spatio-temporal scientific data reduction that stands for *Conditional AutoEncoder with Super-resolution for Augmented Reduction*. The baseline model, **CAESAR-V**, is built on a standard variational autoencoder with scale hyperpriors and super-resolution modules to achieve high compression. It encodes data into a latent space and uses learned priors for compact, information-rich representation.  

The enhanced version, **CAESAR-D**, begins by compressing keyframes using an autoencoder and extends the architecture by incorporating conditional diffusion to interpolate the latent spaces of missing frames between keyframes. This enables high-fidelity reconstruction of intermediate data without requiring their explicit storage.

Additionally, we develop a **GPU-accelerated postprocessing module** that enforces error bounds on the reconstructed data, achieving real-time compression while maintaining rigorous accuracy guarantees. Combined together, this offers a set of solutions that balance compression efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and computational cost for scientific data workflows.

**Experimental results** across multiple scientific datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves significantly better NRMSE rates compared to rule-based compressors such as **SZ3**, especially for higher compression ratios.


## 📦 Installation  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shaw-git/CAESAR.git
cd CAESAR

## 🗂️ Data Organization

All datasets used in this work are stored in NumPy `.npz` format and follow a standardized 5D tensor structure:
[variable, n_samples, T, H, W]
- **variable**: number of physical quantities 
- **n_samples**: number of independent spatial samples
- **T**: number of time steps per sample
- **H/W**: spatial resolution (height × width)

## 🚀 Usage  

### Run compression on dataset  

```bash
python compress.py --config configs/s3d.yaml --pretrained pretrained/caesar_v.pth
```

### Run decompression  

```bash
python decompress.py --config configs/s3d.yaml --pretrained pretrained/caesar_v.pth
```
